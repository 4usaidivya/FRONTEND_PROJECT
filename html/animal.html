        <p class=" info">&ldquo;Animal husbandry&rdquo;is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising of livestock.<br>Husbandry has a long history, starting with the Neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the first crops. By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were being raised on farms.<br>Major changes took place in the Columbian Exchange when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as Robert Bakewell to yield more meat, milk, and wool.</p>

        <h3 class="head mx-2">Why do we need Farmers?</h3>
        <div class="col-md-9">
      
        <p class="info">We need farms for a variety of reasons, besides just a place to get our bread. The domestication of cattle and the dawn of agriculture gave birth to the rise of civilization and the growth of human culture. Much of the work was done by slave labor. As consciousness expanded, hired labor became the norm. Farms are at the cutting edge of a future where people donate labor out of love for their work and each other. As the old saying goes “you don’t count your labor on a farm,” meaning farmers love their whole lifestyle while not regarding money as the most important aspect of it.<br>Although the farmer gets just a few pennies from the dollar we spend on our daily bread, the rest of the dollar is widely distributed. Farms create jobs. For every 6 or 7 farms in a neighborhood, one business sprouts up in town. There are lots of tasks involved in turning farm products into food, clothing and shelter. But the farm is the place where it all starts, where the miracle of photosynthesis annually creates wealth from sun, air, water, and earth. Filling needs with the least effort is true economy. The market economy relies on the productivity of farms.</p>
